# Test-Assistant
The Test-Assistant program allows the user to edit or create a database question within their file explorer/finder. The user may then choose from these databases and generate a test of their desired format and export the test to a PDF document. 

The Test-Assistant program is designed for teachers to store and create tests efficiently. The program has been divided into two sub-programs. 

Functionality

 - May be used to create a new database of questions (a new unit for an example) by saving the questions on a .txt file
